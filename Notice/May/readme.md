We are creating the requirements definition document and use case diagram for our project based on the project execution plan.

1) Understanding the overall requirements definition document and use case diagram

2) For the preparation of the requirements definition document, analyze the technologies to be implemented, the users (any of the shipping company or captain is fine), deep learning techniques needed for technology implementation, benchmarking services (existing similar technologies), and understand the core features.

3) For the preparation of the use case diagram
Creating a use case diagram takes place over three main stages: identifying actors -> identifying use cases -> defining relationships. The part that you should do by the 26th is to understand how actors and use cases are distinguished in our project and write them down.

So,
Analyzing who handles the information, who is interested in the requirements, who maintains and manages the system for operation, and what are the hardware/software that will interact with the system being developed, etc., and understanding who the actors related to the system are (users/external systems) in this project,
Once the actor analysis is done, identify the use cases through the functions required by the actor, the information they want to add/create/view/delete, etc.
