## Project Introduction
This project is expected to play an important role in the maritime logistics industry, which has a significant impact on South Korea's trade and economic development. The maritime logistics industry is a crucial industry worldwide, and South Korea actively promotes domestic and international trade activities for economic development. However, the industry is currently facing various challenges, including complex regulations. SOLAS and MARPOL are two representative examples of international maritime conventions. SOLAS contains regulations for ship safety, while MARPOL is a convention for preserving the marine environment, managing waste, and pollutants.

Some examples of the problems in the maritime logistics industry include the difficulty in real-time tracking of ship positions and environmental issues caused by marine pollution. Furthermore, accidents in the maritime logistics industry require sufficient preparation for disaster recovery, which is often inadequate.

These regulations and challenges highlight the importance of collecting and analyzing information on various incidents in the maritime logistics industry. This project will use NLP technology to collect and classify news related to the domestic and international maritime logistics industry. It aims to provide users with easy access to information on regulations and challenges.

This project has various practical applications. For example, professionals in the port industry can use the application to obtain information on the maritime logistics industry, allowing them to make more efficient decisions. Additionally, the application can improve understanding of foreign trade and promote the development of South Korea's trade. Students interested in the maritime logistics industry or news media seeking information on the industry can also use the application.

This project is expected to contribute significantly to the development of South Korea's maritime logistics industry and trade and provide accurate and reliable information to professionals and the public. This project may also propose and develop new technologies for NLP and news analysis, leading to research and publication of new services and technologies.

## Background and Necessity
The background for planning this service was the lack of accurate and reliable information that users need in the South Korean maritime logistics industry. The maritime logistics industry plays a very important role in the economic development and trade of South Korea, and various problems are arising as a result. However, finding information about them is not an easy task, and even among the various news articles related to incidents, it was difficult to find reliable ones. The maritime logistics industry accounts for over 95% of South Korea's trade volume and plays a very important role in the country's economic development. However, since 2020, due to international trade disputes and COVID-19, the maritime logistics industry has faced many difficulties.

One of the problems in the maritime logistics industry is the instability of cargo transportation. Problems such as accidents or delays that occur during cargo transportation cause a lot of losses every year and undermine the stability of the maritime logistics industry. The maritime logistics industry is currently facing fierce competition worldwide, and there are major problems due to the existing fixed cost structure and inefficiency caused by high-capacity transportation. These problems are considered factors that limit the growth of the maritime logistics industry.

In the maritime logistics industry, various crimes occur frequently. Crimes such as illegal operations, theft, and robbery cause significant damage to the maritime logistics industry. Reliable information and data are essential for preventing such crimes and tracking down criminals.

Therefore, we have determined that collecting and analyzing accurate and reliable information and data to increase the stability and efficiency of the maritime logistics industry is very important. Using NLP technology and news analysis technology, this chatbot and news integrated application can be used as a solution to solve various problems in the maritime logistics industry and help users obtain accurate and reliable information. Additionally, this can contribute to the development of trade by increasing the stability and efficiency of the maritime logistics industry.
