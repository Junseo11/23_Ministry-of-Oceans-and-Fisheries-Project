## Project Introduction
This project aims to use AI technology to analyze and collect the latest news in the field of maritime logistics and develop a personalized recommendation system for users. Through the results of this project, users can easily and quickly access news that they are interested in, and can obtain high-quality information related to maritime logistics from among the various news that is pouring in real-time. Based on this, they can keep up-to-date with the latest trends in the maritime logistics industry.

The four main technologies that make up this project are as follows:

- Web Crawling
  - To collect the latest news from domestic and international news sites, web crawling technology will be used. This will allow us to collect real-time news data and analyze it.

- NLP
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology will be used to analyze the collected news data. This will involve analyzing text data, extracting keywords, and conducting sentiment analysis.
Recommendation System
By analyzing user profiles, search histories, and previous recommendation results, a personalized news recommendation algorithm will be developed. This system will allow users to primarily access the news they want.

- Search Function
  - Users can search for and filter news related to specific keywords on their own.


> The biggest advantage of this project is the personalized news recommendation system for users. Through this system, users can easily and quickly access news in their areas of interest, and are expected to have an easier time keeping up with the latest trends in the logistics industry. The search and recommendation functions will also make it easier for users to find the information they want, which will be a great help to those working in the maritime logistics industry.

> Background and Proposal
>>- The field of maritime logistics is rapidly changing and steadily growing. Keeping up-to-date with the latest trends is becoming a competitive advantage, and news information has become an important asset. However, collecting and analyzing a large amount of news data is difficult and time-consuming.
>>- Therefore, we plan to use AI technology to collect and analyze the latest news in the field of maritime logistics, develop an algorithm that can provide personalized recommendations to users, and make it into a service. This will allow users to easily and quickly access news that they are interested in, and keep up-to-date with the latest trends in the industry.

## Main Functions
>- Development of AI-based chatbot and recommendation algorithm model
>- Development of a recommendation algorithm that can provide customized recommendations by analyzing user's desired keywords and interests
>- Visual representation of news data and analysis results
>- Development of an algorithm to update real-time collected news data
>- Development of an intuitive and user-friendly UI
>- Development of a feature that allows users to bookmark specific news for future reference
>- Sharing function to other SNS platforms of the news currently being viewed
>- Notification function to send news related to the user's interest keywords
>- Feature to display the latest news related to maritime logistics on the app main screen.


## Applied Technologies
>- The overall execution involves collecting data on domestic and international news that is updated in real-time on the internet, categorizing them by category, and delivering them to users. If a user enters a specific keyword, information related to that keyword and desired company is provided
>- The developed model is stored in a deep learning server, and when information is entered into the trained model, the results of news from the past to the present related to that information are provided
>- News is categorized and classified by category and provided accordingly.
>- A mobile development platform is used to guide the above deep learning operations to fit the mobile device
>- A push notification is developed to inform the database server and administrators of the data to be stored
>- Through the collection and learning of domestic and international logistics data, an AI chatbot specializing in maritime logistics is developed
